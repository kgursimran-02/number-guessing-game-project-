This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts in C, including:

Random number generation using the rand() and srand() functions

Input and output handling using scanf() and printf()

Looping constructs (while, do-while, or for)

Conditional statements (if-else)

Basic logic implementation for game control

The game can also be enhanced with features such as a limited number of attempts, difficulty levels, and score tracking.

Features:

Random number generation within a specified range (e.g., 1–100).

User input for guessing the number.

Feedback to the player (e.g., “Too high!” or “Too low!”).

Counting the number of attempts made.

Option to play again after the game ends.

Example Flow of the Game:

The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.

The user enters their guess.

The program checks the guess:

If the guess is higher than the number, it displays “Too high!”

If the guess is lower, it displays “Too low!”

If the guess is correct, it displays “Congratulations! You guessed it in X attempts.”

The player can choose to play again or exit.

Sample Output:
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
I have chosen a number between 1 and 100.
Can you guess it?

Enter your guess: 45
Too low! Try again.
Enter your guess: 78
Too high! Try again.
Enter your guess: 63
Congratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts!
Do you want to play again? (y/n): n
Thank you for playing!

Learning Outcomes:

Understanding random number generation in C

Implementing conditional logic and loops

Handling user input safely

Structuring small-scale console applications# number-guessing-game-project-
The Number Guessing Game is a simple console-based program written in the C programming language. The main objective of the game is to allow the player to guess a randomly generated number within a given range. The program provides hints to the player, such as whether the guessed number is too high or too low, until the correct number is guessed.
